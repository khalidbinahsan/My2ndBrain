## Eloquent
Laravel Eloquent is the object-relational mapper (ORM) included with Laravel, which provides a simple and elegant way to interact with the database. Eloquent makes it easy to work with databases by allowing developers to interact with their database tables as if they were working with PHP objects. Each database table has a corresponding "Model" that is used to interact with that table.
